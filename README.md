# NextJS Starter Blog Template with Markdown Files

This is a basic blog template that includes:

- Next.js app using SSR, API routes, and persistent layouts
- SCSS modules
- Content sourced from Markdown files
- Search

## Getting Started

You can start a new repo by using this as a [template](https://github.com/ctrble/next-md-blog-template/generate).

Requires: `yarn`, `node`.

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Deployment

This project is most easily deployed via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), but should work on other platforms if they support serverless functions. You may need to install and configure additional packages if you deploy elsewhere, such as [next-on-netlify](https://github.com/FinnWoelm/next-on-netlify) if you'd prefer to use Netlify.
